# CSCI-7850
# Stock Price Prediction Project

This project involves stock price prediction for Google stocks using various machine learning models and analysis techniques.

## Introduction

This repository contains code and data related to stock price prediction for Google stocks. The primary aim is to explore different machine learning models, particularly GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) models, for predicting stock prices based on historical data.

## Files

- **GRU.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing code for implementing GRU models, training, and evaluation.
- **Google_Stocks_Test.csv**: CSV file containing test data for Google stock prices.
- **Google_Stocks_Train.csv**: CSV file containing training data for Google stock prices.
- **Plots.py**: Python script with functions for generating various plots and visualizations related to stock price analysis.
- **Stock.py**: Python script containing functions and classes for stock data processing and analysis.
- **requirements.txt**: File listing all required dependencies and their versions for running the code.
- **train_loss.csv**: CSV file recording training loss values during model training.
- **val_loss.csv**: CSV file recording validation loss values during model training.

## Usage

To reproduce the analysis or run the code:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/harshitkumar007/CSCI-7800.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the `GRU.ipynb` notebook to train and evaluate the GRU models.
5. Use `Plots.py` and `Stock.py` scripts for additional analysis and visualization.

Note: Make sure to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.
